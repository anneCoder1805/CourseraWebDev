					Determination
				</h2>
				<p>
					You must have an aim. Relentlessly working to achieve it - no matter what you might face on the path - is what gives your life a meaning. You may aim low, you may aim high, but once the goal is set, put in your every muscle to attain it.

					Optimism
				</h2>
				<p>
					Even if today did not go the way you planned, if you could find enough reasons to smile at the present moment, do not fret. Always be optimistic and make sure that you have it in yourself to make the future  a beautiful place to live in.

					Humility
				</h2>
				<p>
					Howsoever strong and prosperous you have become, never forget that each life form has its own value. Yes, you matter to the world, but so does everyone else. Remember your roots, remeber the efforts you put in to be where you are.
